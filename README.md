Worldsafecoin platform has been a 100% community project since the beginning. This means that the decision-making power lies with all community members according to their voting power. This approach can essentially be seen as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). All processes from platform development to marketing and documentation are organized decentrally. The “power” belongs to the users - the only consistent and fair approach of a blockchain. The Worldsafecoin platform is designed in such a way that users can decide independently of large investors, developers or the founders. For example, all new features are voted on in advance using the built-in e-voting.

Our goal is the worldwide acceptance of our WorldsafeCoin both online and offline. With our own marketplace, everyone can buy and sell things, whether it's cars, houses, jewelry. We are building our own ecosystem, whether it's paid in Fiat or with our own coin. We are already working to ensure that we can secure our assets via the blockchain. we alone are the only ones who decide what will become of our wealth
